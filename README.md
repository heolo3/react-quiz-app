This is a practice React project desgined to create a React quiz, in which users cycle through a pre-determined set of questions before being presented their final score/performance report. The project leveraged close implementation of useState, useRef, and useEffect
to ensure proper functionality, which included a timer for each question, the ability for Question components to check for in/correct answers, and store user answer for the performance summary at the end of the quiz. Additionally, the project implemented a variety of timers
to force the user to answer a question within a set time, display the in/correct answer for some time after a given answer is selected, and prevent concurrent timers from advancing through questions depending on the user's actions on previous questions.
